				},
				"q4": {
					"question": "How to use exported CSS variables?",
					"answer": "Copy the code from the 'CSS Variables' section and add it to your stylesheet (e.g., globals.css) in the :root block. After that, you can use variables in CSS: var(--color-primary), var(--color-primary-hover), etc."

				},
				"q2": {
					"question": "How to choose base color?",
					"answer": "You can enter a color in HEX (#3498db), RGB (rgb(52, 152, 219)) or HSL (hsl(204, 70%, 53%)) format. A 'Random Color' button is also available for quick generation of a random base color."
				},
				"q3": {
					"question": "How many colors in a palette?",
					"answer": "The number of colors depends on the mode: monochromatic — 6 colors, analogous — 5 colors, complementary — 6 colors, triad — 8 colors, tetradic — 4 colors, shades/tints/tones — 6 colors."
