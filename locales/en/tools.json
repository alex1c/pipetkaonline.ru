				"title": "Frequently asked questions about UI Theme Generator",
				"q1": {
					"question": "What are UI tokens?",
					"answer": "UI tokens are named color values used in design systems. They ensure color consistency in interfaces and simplify theme maintenance. Examples: primary, secondary, background, foreground."
				},
				"q2": {
					"question": "How does token generation work?",
					"answer": "Generator uses base color and creates variations through lightening/darkening (for hover/active states), mixing with neutral colors (for secondary), and automatic contrast color selection (for foreground). Status colors are generated by adjusting hue."
				},
				"q3": {
					"question": "What is Auto mode?",
					"answer": "Auto mode automatically determines whether theme should be light or dark based on base color brightness. If base color is light (luma >= 0.5), light theme is selected, otherwise dark theme."
				},
				"q4": {
					"question": "How to use exported tokens?",
					"answer": "CSS Variables can be used directly in CSS: var(--color-primary). Tailwind config should be added to tailwind.config.js. JSON tokens are suitable for integration into design systems. Figma Tokens can be imported into Figma via plugin."
				},
				"q5": {
					"question": "Why do some color pairs fail contrast check?",
					"answer": "If base color is too light or dark, automatically generated foreground colors may not provide sufficient contrast. In this case, it's recommended to choose a different base color or manually adjust foreground colors."
				},
				"q6": {
					"question": "Can I edit tokens manually?",
					"answer": "In current version, tokens are generated automatically. For manual editing, you can copy exported values and modify them in your project. Future versions plan to add manual editing capability."

				},
				"q2": {
					"question": "How is contrast calculated?",

				},
				"q3": {
					"question": "What does heatmap show?",

				},
				"q4": {
					"question": "How to improve text contrast?",
					"answer": "Use more contrasting text color (white on dark background or black on light), add background overlay with opacity adjustment, increase font size, move text to area with better contrast, add text shadow."
				},
				"q5": {
					"question": "Is background overlay considered in contrast calculation?",
					"answer": "Yes, if background overlay is enabled, contrast is calculated between text color and overlay color. If overlay is disabled, contrast is calculated between text and local image color under text."
				},
				"q6": {
					"question": "What font size is considered large?",
					"answer": "According to WCAG, large text is text 18pt (24px) and larger, or text 14pt (18.67px) and larger in bold. Large text requires lower contrast (3:1 instead of 4.5:1)."

					"question": "What's the difference between HSL and LAB for brightness calculation?",

					"answer": "8 modes are available: analogous (adjacent colors ±30°), monochromatic (shades of one color), complementary (opposite colors 180°), split complementary (150°, 210°), triadic (120°), tetradic (90°), square (90° × 4), and neutral (low saturation)."
				},
				"q2": {
					"question": "How to choose base color?",
					"answer": "You can enter a color in HEX (#3498db), RGB (rgb(52, 152, 219)) or HSL (hsl(204, 70%, 53%)) format. A 'Random Color' button is also available for quick generation of a random base color."
				},
				"q3": {
					"question": "What is analogous harmony?",
					"answer": "Analogous harmony uses colors adjacent on the color wheel (±30°). This creates a calm and harmonious color scheme, perfect for natural and soothing designs."
				},
				"q4": {
					"question": "What is complementary harmony?",
					"answer": "Complementary harmony uses opposite colors on the color wheel (180° apart). This creates high contrast and visual appeal, perfect for accents and call-to-action elements."
				},
				"q5": {
					"question": "What does the color relation diagram show?",
					"answer": "The diagram shows a visualization of harmonious colors on the color wheel. Lines show angular offsets between colors, which helps understand color harmony theory and relationships between colors."
				},
				"q6": {
					"question": "Can I use harmonious colors for CSS?",
					"answer": "Yes, all colors in the harmonious scheme are available in HEX, RGB, and HSL formats that can be directly used in CSS. Simply copy the needed code and paste it into your CSS file."
				},
				"q7": {
					"question": "How to copy color code?",
					"answer": "Click on any color code (HEX, RGB, or HSL) in the color card. The code will be copied to your clipboard, and you'll see a confirmation '✓ Copied'."
				},
				"q8": {
					"question": "Can I use harmonious colors for web design?",
					"answer": "Yes, color harmony finder is perfect for web design. You can create a harmonious color scheme for your website, copy codes, and use them in CSS, design tools, or design systems."
