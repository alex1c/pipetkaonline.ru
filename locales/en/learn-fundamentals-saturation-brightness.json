		"intro": "Saturation and brightness are two fundamental color properties that determine visual perception and emotional impact. Understanding these properties is critical for creating effective color schemes, design systems, and visual compositions.\n\nIn this detailed guide, we'll cover how saturation and brightness affect color perception, their applications in various design fields, and practical techniques for working with these properties.\n\nYou'll learn how to use [tool:ui-theme-generator] to create themes with different saturation and brightness levels, apply [tool:color-harmony] to generate harmonious combinations, and work with [tool:palette-generator] to create expressive palettes.",

			"title": "Saturation: Intensity and Color Purity",
			"content": "Saturation determines the intensity or purity of a color. High saturation means bright, pure color without gray impurities. Low saturation creates muted, pastel, or grayish shades.\n\nIn the HSL model, saturation is measured from 0% (fully unsaturated, gray) to 100% (maximum saturated, pure color). Saturated colors attract attention, create energy, and visual interest. Unsaturated colors are more calm, professional, and universal.\n\nIn web design, high saturation is used for accents, call-to-action buttons, and important elements. Low saturation — for backgrounds, text, and neutral elements. The [tool:ui-theme-generator] tool allows automatically creating color schemes with different saturation levels to create the desired atmosphere."

		"section2": {
			"title": "Brightness: Lightness and Darkness of Color",
			"content": "Brightness (or lightness) determines how light or dark a color is. High brightness creates light, pastel colors. Low brightness — dark, deep shades.\n\nIn the HSL model, brightness is measured from 0% (black) to 100% (white), with 50% producing a pure color. Brightness is critical for contrast and text readability. Dark colors on light backgrounds and light on dark create good contrast.\n\nWhen creating dark and light themes, brightness is a key parameter. Dark themes use low brightness for backgrounds and high for text. Light themes — vice versa. The [tool:color-harmony] tool considers brightness when generating harmonious color combinations, ensuring proper contrast and visual balance."

		"section3": {
			"title": "Combining Saturation and Brightness in Design",
			"content": "By combining different levels of saturation and brightness, you can create a wide range of color variations and moods. High saturation + high brightness create bright, energetic colors. Low saturation + low brightness — calm, professional shades.\n\nIn branding, saturation and brightness determine brand character. Bright, saturated colors convey energy and innovation. Muted, unsaturated — stability and professionalism.\n\nWhen creating palettes, [tool:palette-generator] uses various combinations of saturation and brightness to create expressive and harmonious color schemes. For accessibility, it's important to control brightness to ensure sufficient contrast between elements."
		},
		"conclusion": "Saturation and brightness are powerful tools for creating visually appealing and emotionally effective designs.\n\nProper use of these properties allows creating color schemes that are not only beautiful but also functional, accessible, and aligned with project goals. Use modern tools to experiment with various combinations of saturation and brightness.",
