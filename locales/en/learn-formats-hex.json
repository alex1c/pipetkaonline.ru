		"intro": "HEX (hexadecimal) color format is the industry standard for representing colors in web development. In this comprehensive guide, we'll cover everything you need to know about HEX codes: from basics to advanced usage techniques.\n\nYou'll learn how to work with [tool:color-converter] for format conversion, use [tool:color-lab] to extract colors from images, and apply [tool:ui-tokens-generator] for creating design systems.",
		"section1": {
			"title": "What is HEX Format and Why It's So Popular",
			"content": "HEX (hexadecimal) is a base-16 numbering system used to encode colors in web development. Each HEX code consists of a hash symbol (#) and six characters, which can be digits from 0 to 9 or letters from A to F.\n\nThe first two characters represent the red channel, the next two represent green, and the last two represent blue. For example, #FF5733 means red=255, green=87, blue=51.\n\nHEX format advantages are obvious: compactness (only 7 characters), readability, universal support in all browsers and development tools. HEX codes are used in CSS, HTML, JavaScript, graphics editors, and design systems.\n\nModern tools like [tool:color-converter] allow instant conversion of HEX to RGB, HSL, and other formats, significantly simplifying designers' work."
		},
		"section2": {
			"title": "Practical Application of HEX Codes in Web Design",
			"content": "In modern web development, HEX codes are used everywhere. CSS properties like background-color, color, and border-color accept HEX values directly. For example, background-color: #3498db creates a blue background.\n\nHTML style attributes also support HEX: style=\"color: #e74c3c\". JavaScript developers use HEX for dynamically changing element colors through the style property. CSS gradients also support HEX: linear-gradient(to right, #667eea, #764ba2).\n\nFor large projects, it's recommended to use [tool:ui-tokens-generator], which automatically creates a complete set of color tokens from a single HEX value. This ensures design consistency and simplifies color scheme maintenance.\n\nWhen working with images, [tool:color-lab] allows extracting HEX codes directly from photos and designs, which is especially useful when creating brand books and color palettes."
		},
		"section3": {
			"title": "Advanced Techniques and Best Practices",
			"content": "Experienced developers use several advanced techniques when working with HEX codes. Shorthand notation allows using 3 characters instead of 6: #F53 is equivalent to #FF5533. Alpha channel in HEX8 format adds transparency: #FF5733FF (last two characters are transparency from 00 to FF).\n\nFor dark themes, it's recommended to use darker shades with low brightness (lower channel values), for light themes — high brightness. Text contrast is critical for accessibility: use [tool:contrast-checker] to verify WCAG compliance.\n\nWhen creating color palettes, [tool:palette-generator] automatically generates harmonious combinations based on your HEX color. For branding, [tool:brand-color-analyzer] analyzes your palette's HEX codes and provides detailed usage recommendations."
		},
		"conclusion": "HEX format remains the gold standard of web development thanks to its simplicity, universality, and wide support.\n\nMastering HEX codes is an essential skill for any web designer and developer. Use modern tools for working with colors, experiment with palettes, and always check contrast to ensure your projects' accessibility.",
