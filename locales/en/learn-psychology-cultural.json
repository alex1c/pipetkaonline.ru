			"title": "Practical Recommendations for International Design",

Create adapted design versions for various cultural regions.\n\nTest color schemes with representatives of target cultures. This allows identifying potential issues before publication. The [tool:palette-generator] tool helps create universal color schemes that work in various cultural contexts."
