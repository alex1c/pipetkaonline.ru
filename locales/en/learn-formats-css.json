		"intro": "CSS provides an extensive set of predefined color keywords, from basic (red, blue, green) to extended (coral, skyblue, tomato, teal). These keywords simplify color work in CSS but have limitations in precision and number of available shades.\n\nIn this detailed guide, we'll cover all CSS color keywords, their applications, advantages, and disadvantages. You'll learn how to use [tool:color-name-finder] to find color names, work with [tool:color-converter] to convert keywords to HEX/RGB, and apply [tool:ui-tokens-generator] to create design systems based on CSS colors.",

			"title": "Basic and Extended CSS Color Keywords",
			"content": "The CSS standard defines 147 color keywords, including basic colors (red, blue, green, yellow, black, white, gray) and an extended palette (coral, skyblue, tomato, teal, lavender, salmon, turquoise, and many others).\n\nEach keyword corresponds to a specific HEX value, for example, 'red' is equivalent to #FF0000, 'blue' is #0000FF. These keywords are convenient for quick prototyping and learning but are limited in precision.\n\nFor professional projects, it's recommended to use HEX, RGB, or HSL formats for precise color control. The [tool:color-name-finder] tool allows finding the name of any color, including CSS keywords, and getting their exact HEX/RGB values."

		"section2": {
			"title": "Practical Application of CSS Color Keywords",
			"content": "CSS color keywords are used in properties like color, background-color, border-color, and others. Syntax is simple: color: red; background-color: blue;. They are especially useful for quick prototyping, learning, and creating simple interfaces.\n\nHowever, for precise brand colors, gradients, and complex design systems, it's better to use HEX or RGB values. Modern tools like [tool:color-converter] allow instant conversion of CSS keywords to HEX, RGB, HSL formats, which is critical when working with design mockups.\n\nWhen creating design systems, [tool:ui-tokens-generator] uses precise color values instead of keywords to ensure consistency and control."
		},
		"section3": {
			"title": "Limitations and Best Practices",
			"content": "The main limitation of CSS color keywords is a fixed set of 147 colors, which is insufficient for modern design projects. Also, there's no control over shades, saturation, and brightness.\n\nFor creating themes, gradients, and accessible interfaces, precise color values are necessary. When working with branding, it's important to use precise brand colors, not approximate keywords.\n\nFor contrast checking, use [tool:contrast-checker], which works with precise color values. When creating color palettes, [tool:palette-generator] generates harmonious combinations based on precise HEX/RGB values, not keywords."
